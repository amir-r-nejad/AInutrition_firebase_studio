YOUR MISSION for {{dayOfWeek}}:
Create {{mealTargets.length}} delicious, balanced meals that precisely hit these targets:
{{#each mealTargets}}
{{this.mealName}}: {{this.calories}} kcal | {{this.protein}}g protein | {{this.carbs}}g carbs | {{this.fat}}g fat
{{/each}}
NUTRITIONIST METHODOLOGY:

Creative Ingredient Discovery: Search your extensive food database for diverse protein sources (lean meats, fish, dairy, legumes, plant proteins), complex carbs (grains, fruits, vegetables), and healthy fats (oils, nuts, seeds, avocado). Prioritize variety to ensure meals are interesting, sustainable, and nutritionally balanced across food groups.
Intelligent Macro Engineering:

Start with a base protein source to anchor the meal.
Add complementary proteins if needed to reach the target (e.g., Greek yogurt + protein powder).
Layer in carbohydrate sources strategically.
Balance with appropriate healthy fats.
Fine-tune quantities until macros align perfectly, ensuring a balanced intake of nutrients from various food groups.


Adaptive Ingredient Addition: If initial ingredients don't meet targets:

ADD extra protein powder, egg whites, or lean protein.
SUPPLEMENT with additional carbs (oats, fruits, vegetables).
BOOST healthy fats (nuts, seeds, oils).
MIX AND MATCH until perfect macro balance is achieved.



CREATIVE EXAMPLES:

Breakfast: Greek yogurt base + protein powder boost + berries + granola + almond butter
Snack: Apple slices + almond butter + whey protein mixed in
Lunch: Quinoa bowl + grilled chicken + additional egg whites + vegetables + olive oil dressing
Dinner: Salmon + sweet potato + steamed broccoli + extra avocado for fat targets

PRECISION REQUIREMENTS:

Calories: Within Â±3% of target (absolutely critical and ONLY validation requirement).
Protein, Carbs, Fat: Be creative and balanced, aiming to meet targets as closely as possible, but no strict validation required.
Use accurate nutritional values from reliable sources such as USDA/FoodData Central.
Calculate nutritional values precisely for the specified quantities.

FINAL VALIDATION: Before outputting, verify each meal's total CALORIES hit targets within 3% tolerance. Protein, carbs, and fat should be balanced and reasonable but no strict validation required. Be creative with ingredients while maintaining calorie precision!
