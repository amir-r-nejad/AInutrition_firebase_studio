Objective: Design and develop a complete front-end overhaul for the "NutriPlan" website (based on the provided screenshot) to include both nutrition planning and workout planning features. The goal is to create a fully functional, responsive web application that mirrors the nutrition plan structure for the workout plan section and enhances the profile section. The final product should be production-ready with HTML, CSS (using Tailwind CSS), and JavaScript.

#### Requirements

1. **Dashboard Structure**:
   - Split the dashboard into two main sections:
     - **Nutrition Plan Section**: Retain the existing layout and functionality from the screenshot (e.g., Current Weight, Daily Calories, Body Fat %, Activity Level, Weight Progress, Body Composition, Daily Macronutrient Targets). Use the same visual style (green progress bars, light yellow background, etc.).
     - **Workout Plan Section**: Create a parallel structure to the nutrition section with the following fields:
       - **Current Fitness Level**: (e.g., Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced) with a target field.
       - **Daily Activity**: (e.g., minutes of exercise) with a goal field.
       - **Fitness Composition**: (e.g., Strength level, Endurance level) with target fields.
       - **Workout Days/Week**: (e.g., 1-7 days) with a goal field.
       - **Workout Progress**: A progress bar similar to Weight Progress, showing progress toward a 1-month fitness goal.
       - **Fitness Composition**: A progress bar for strength and endurance targets.
       - **Weekly Workout Targets**: A breakdown similar to Macronutrient Targets, including Cardio, Strength, and Flexibility with target values.

2. **Enhanced Profile Section**:
   - Add the following editable fields to the profile (accessible via a "Profile" link in the sidebar):
     - Age (number input)
     - Gender (dropdown: Male, Female, Other)
     - Height (cm, number input)
     - Fitness History (text area for years of experience or past activities)
     - Injuries/Limitations (text area for conditions like back pain)
     - Activity Level (dropdown: Sedentary, Moderate, Active)
   - Include a "Save Profile" button to update the dashboard with the new data.
   - Display a summary of all profile data on the dashboard (e.g., "Profile: 30y, Male, 170cm, Beginner, Active").

3. **Interactive Features**:
   - Add a "Generate Plan" button for both Nutrition and Workout sections.
     - When clicked, it should:
       - Collect input data from profile and section-specific fields.
       - Generate a plan based on simple logic (e.g., for nutrition: calculate calories based on weight and activity; for workouts: suggest 3-5 exercises based on fitness level and days/week).
       - Display the generated plan below the button (e.g., a table for workouts with days, exercises, sets, reps; a list for macronutrients).
   - Include form validation to ensure required fields (e.g., weight, fitness level) are filled before generating a plan.
   - Use local storage to save user inputs and generated plans.

4. **UI/UX Design**:
   - Use Tailwind CSS for styling with a modern, clean design.
   - Maintain the existing color scheme (green #10B981, white, light yellow #FEFCE8, gray accents).
   - Ensure a responsive layout that works on desktop, tablet, and mobile (use Tailwindâ€™s grid and flex utilities).
   - Add tooltips or help icons (e.g., "?" next to fields) with brief explanations (e.g., "Fitness Level: Your current exercise experience").
   - Keep the "Download PDF Report" button, extending it to include both nutrition and workout plans in a single PDF.

5. **Sidebar Navigation**:
   - Retain the existing sidebar with links: Dashboard, Profile, Smart Calorie Planner, Macro Splitter, Meal Suggestions, Current Meal Plan, All Meal Plan, Chatbot Support.
   - Add a logout button at the bottom with the user email (e.g., "parsamx24@gmail.com").

6. **Sample Logic for Plan Generation** (to guide JavaScript):
   - **Nutrition Plan**: If weight is 64 kg and activity is "Moderate", suggest ~2000 kcal, with 25% protein, 50% carbs, 25% fat.
   - **Workout Plan**: If fitness level is "Beginner" and 3 days/week, suggest 3 exercises (e.g., squats 3x10, push-ups 3x8, planks 3x30s) per day.

#### Technical Specifications
- **Technologies**: HTML, CSS (Tailwind CSS), JavaScript (vanilla, no frameworks).
- **File Structure**: Single `index.html` file with embedded CSS and JS (for simplicity).
- **Performance**: Optimize for fast loading and smooth interactions.
- **Testing**: Ensure the design works across Chrome, Firefox, and Safari on various screen sizes.

#### Deliverables
- A complete `index.html` file with all features implemented.
- Comments in the code explaining key sections and logic.
- A brief README in the HTML comments explaining how to use the application.

#### Constraints
- Do not use external libraries beyond Tailwind CSS.
- Avoid complex backend integration; use client-side logic only.
- Ensure all data is stored locally (no server-side storage).
